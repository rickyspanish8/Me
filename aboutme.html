<h1>More About me:</h1>
<p>I was born and raised in Venezuela, after ending my studies in laws, I moved to Spain.<br></p>
<br>
<h2>Spain:</h2>   
<p>I lived in Spain for about 10 years, living there I tried different sectors and felt in love  <br>
about working with computers. I also made my studies in business. Living there I started to  <br>
think about living abroad and experience how it is to live in other countries, So I started<br>
to learn german and in 2020 I moved to Germany. </p>
<br>
<h2>Germany:</h2>
<p>In Germany I landed at the same time where Corona did, so it was complicated to keep going<br>
with the learning process of the german language, but after a year, schools were open again and<br>
I could keep going and got a fluent level of German. after some more months I was working in <br>
Germany but my wife found a Job in Switzerland and we decided to move to Switzerland.   </p>
<br>
<h2>Switzerland:</h2>
<p>I started to live in Switzerland in May 2022, I found a remote job as IT support in a Venezuelan <br>
company but my wish is to find a job in a local company. I also did a SAP FI consultant course<br>
and im learning web development. </p>
